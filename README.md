### Exercise Instructions: **"Arduino-LED-Blinker"** ðŸ“Ÿ

**Objective:**  
Create an Arduino program that makes an LED connected to pin 4 blink at a 3-second interval.  

**Requirements:**  
1. Set pin 4 as an output (`OUTPUT`).  
2. Turn on the LED by sending a `HIGH` signal to pin 4 for 3 seconds.  
3. Turn off the LED by sending a `LOW` signal to pin 4 for 3 seconds.  
4. Repeat the process continuously (infinite loop).  

**Hints:**  
- Use the following functions:
  - `pinMode()` to configure pins.  
  - `digitalWrite()` to control the LED state.  
  - `delay()` to introduce pauses.  

**Required Materials:**  
- An Arduino board (UNO, Mega, etc.).  
- An LED.  
- A resistor (220Î© recommended).  
- Connecting wires.  

**Possible Extension:**  
Add a button to control the LED's on and off states.  

Good luck! ðŸš€
